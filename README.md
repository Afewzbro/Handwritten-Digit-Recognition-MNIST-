# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-MNIST-
This project aims to create a model that recognizes handwritten digits using the famous MNIST dataset. The repository contains all the necessary code files and the trained model.

## Project Description
In this project, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. We implement the model using TensorFlow and Keras, and we evaluate different network architectures and hyperparameters to achieve the best accuracy.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
TensorFlow 2.0+
Keras
OpenCV (for preprocessing custom images)
Numpy, Matplotlib (for data visualization)
